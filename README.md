# react-image-finder
A simple ReactJS app that calls the PixaBay API for image search queries and displays them in a grid. It uses MaterialUI, and is based on Brad Traversy's example. Done for educational/learning purposes.

The allows the user to search for what it is they want to see, and the number of pictures, like so:

Once the images have returned, the user can click on the 'zoom' icon on each picture, which will open a dialogue box with a zoomed in picture, and an option to close to the dialogue box:
